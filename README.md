  <strong>A radically secure, 100% offline, browser-based password manager.</strong>
  <br />
  Your data is your own. Keep it that way.
  <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold"> A completely offline, self-hosted password manager that securely stores your sensitive information directly in your browser. All data is encrypted with your master password and never leaves your device.</p>
</p>

In a world where every service lives in the cloud, **Offline Vault** takes a different approach. It's a password manager built on the principle of absolute data sovereignty. Your sensitive information is encrypted with military-grade algorithms and stored *exclusively* in your browser's secure local storage. **No servers, no cloud, no accounts, no tracking. Ever.**

## üíé Core Philosophy

-   üîê **Absolute Privacy**: Your data never leaves your device. Period. We have no servers to hack, no logs to leak, and no way to access your information, even if we wanted to.
-   üí™ **Unyielding Security**: We leverage the browser's native, battle-tested Web Crypto API for all cryptographic operations. No compromises.
-   üïäÔ∏è **Simplicity & Control**: No accounts to create, no subscriptions to manage. You are in complete control of your data, with simple tools to manage and back it up.
-   üåê **Ultimate Portability**: Runs in any modern web browser. Use it on any OS without installation.

## ‚ú® Features

#### Uncompromising Security & Privacy
-   üîí **End-to-End Encryption**: Utilizes the browser's native Web Crypto API to perform **AES-GCM 256-bit** encryption. Your data is encrypted at rest and never leaves your device.
-   üîë **Robust Key Derivation**: Your master password is strengthened using **PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations** and a unique salt, making brute-force attacks computationally infeasible.
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Confirmations**: Explicit warnings and confirmations before critical actions like creating a vault or exporting unencrypted data, ensuring you understand the risks.
-   ‚è≤Ô∏è **Configurable Auto-Lock**: Automatically lock your vault after a period of inactivity (from 1 minute to never) to protect against unauthorized physical access.
-   ‚ö° **Strong Password Generator**: Create cryptographically secure, random passwords with customizable length and character sets (uppercase, numbers, symbols).
-   üìä **Real-time Strength Meter**: A visual password strength meter provides instant feedback as you type, helping you create stronger passwords.

#### Effortless Organization & Management
-   üóÇÔ∏è **Full Category Management**: Create, edit, and delete custom, color-coded categories to organize your entries visually.
-   üìù **Detailed Entries**: Store a service name, username, password, and detailed notes. The app automatically fetches the website's **favicon** for quick identification.
-   üîç **Powerful Filtering & Sorting**: Instantly find entries with live search. Sort by service name, username, or last modified date, and filter by any category.
-   üíæ **Flexible Data Management**: Easily import and export your entire vault as a JSON file. Choose to **merge** with your existing data or **replace** it completely.

#### Modern & Dynamic User Experience
-   üé® **Stunning "Illumina" UI**: A beautiful, modern interface featuring dynamic, animated backgrounds and interactive panels with a subtle glowing border effect on hover.
-   ‚ú® **Subtle Animations**: List items gracefully fade and slide into view, creating a fluid and responsive feel as you navigate your vault.
-   üåà **Rich Theming Engine**: Personalize your vault with over a dozen professionally designed themes. **Live-preview** themes by simply hovering over them in the settings.
-   üåó **Light & Dark Modes**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark modes to suit your preference and environment.
-   üì± **Fully Responsive**: Enjoy a flawless experience on any device, from a large desktop monitor to your mobile phone.
-   üöÄ **Zero Installation**: No build steps, no dependencies. Just open `index.html` in your browser to get started instantly.

## üîê How It Works: The Security Deep Dive

Your security is not just a feature; it's the foundation of Offline Vault. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step look at how your data is protected:

1.  **You Enter Your Master Password**: This password is the *only* key to your vault. It is **never** stored or transmitted.
2.  **Derive the Master Key**: Your password is combined with a unique, randomly generated **salt** and fed into the **PBKDF2** algorithm. After 100,000 rounds of hashing, a powerful 256-bit encryption key is derived. This process is slow by design, thwarting brute-force attacks.
3.  **Encrypt the Vault**: All your data‚Äîevery entry, note, and category‚Äîis converted into a single block of text and then encrypted using **AES-GCM** with the derived key. AES-GCM is an industry standard that ensures both confidentiality (it can't be read) and integrity (it can't be tampered with).
4.  **Store Locally**: The final encrypted data blob, along with the public salt and IV (Initialization Vector), is saved securely in your browser's **localStorage**. This database is sandboxed, meaning other websites cannot access it.
5.  **Unlocking**: When you unlock the vault, the process reverses. The same Master Key is derived from your password and the stored salt, which is then used to decrypt the data blob. **If the password is wrong, decryption fails, and your data remains gibberish.**

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Crucial Warning
> Because of this zero-knowledge design, your Master Password is **NOT RECOVERABLE**. We have no way to reset it. If you forget it, you will lose access to your data forever.
>
> **Please write it down and store it in a secure, physical location.**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone or Download**: Get the project files onto your local machine.
2.  **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
3.  **Create Your Vault**: On your first visit, you will be prompted to create a strong, memorable master password. Read our security best practices to help you create a great one.
4.  **Start Adding Entries**: Click "Add Entry" and begin securing your digital life.
5.  **Lock Up**: When you're done, click the "Lock Vault" button. Your data is now encrypted and safe.

## üíæ Data Management: Import & Export

You are in full control of your data.
-   **Export**: Create a backup of your vault at any time from the Settings menu. This will download a JSON file containing all your entries.
-   **Import**: Restore from a backup or migrate from another manager by importing a JSON file. You have the option to **merge** the imported entries with your current vault or to **replace** your entire existing vault.

> **Security Note**: The exported JSON file is **unencrypted**. Please handle it with extreme care and store it in a secure location, like an encrypted USB drive.
